Categorizes BMI results into:

Underweight,
Normal weight,
Overweight,
Obese,
Severely Obese,
Morbidly Obese.

Requirements:
Python, 
Jupyter Notebook.

BMI Categories:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 – 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 – 29.9
Obese: BMI 30 – 34.9
Severely Obese: BMI 35 – 39.9
Morbidly Obese: BMI ≥ 40
